            <p>I just graduated and got my Software Engineer Certificate from Prime Digital Academy. Prime Digital Academy is an intensive 20-week program that prepares student so they can join the industry as entry-level software engineers. At Prime we learn the most update to date technologies like HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, React.JS, jQuery and Node.js to provide foundational concepts, techniques and design patterns essential in all coding environments. I look forward to utilizing all the skills that I have learned at Prime to build things that only people can imagine about.</p>
           
            <p>During my time with Prime Digital Academy I was able to create a full stack application called Sa-Bai-Dee (Learn Lao). Learning Lao is hard especially if you don't know where to start. If you search online all the contents that you want to study is not all in one page. With Sa-Bai-Dee it list the basic of what you should be studying. You can favorite the words/vocabulary that you want to study more and add personal comments too.</p>
       <p>At Prime, we also get the honor to create an application that help solve a solution for a real life client. For 4 weeks, I worked with a team of 5 members where we planned, scoped, and created an application called JFuerst Scheduling that help streamline our client scheduling system by integrating the client's third party api and google api to help calculate each photographer drive time, mileages, and display all the needed information in one place. Instead of using 3-4 application to create the photographer schedule, our client can just use one.</p>
       <p>Prior to Prime I was in the financial industry for 4+ years and have learned a ton regarding the industry. During my time there, I was in the Production department, Customer Service department and before I left was in the Account Management team where I help mange investors accounts. Not only that, but I was able to acquired a lot of the soft skills that came with all the roles. I'm excited to continue using all the skills that I have learned thus far.</p>
